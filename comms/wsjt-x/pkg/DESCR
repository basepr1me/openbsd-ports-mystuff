WSJT-X implements communication protocols or "modes" called FST4, FST4W, FT4,
FT8, JT4, JT9, JT65, Q65, MSK144, and WSPR, as well as one called Echo for
detecting and measuring your own radio signals reflected from the Moon.  These
modes were all designed for making reliable, confirmed QSOs under extreme
weak-signal conditions.

JT4, JT9, and JT65 use nearly identical message structure and source encoding
(the efficient compression of standard messages used for minimal QSOs). They use
timed 60-second T/R sequences synchronized with UTC.  JT4 and JT65 were designed
for EME ("moonbounce") on the VHF/UHF/microwave bands.  JT9 is optimized for the
MF, and HF bands.  It  is about 2 dB more sensitive than JT65 while using less
than 10% of the bandwidth.  Q65 offers submodes with a wide range of T/R
sequence lengths and tone spacings.

FT4 and FT8 are operationally similar but use T/R cycles only 7.5 and  15 s
long, respectively.  MSK144 is designed for Meteor Scatter on the VHF bands.
These modes offer enhanced message formats with support for nonstandard
callsigns and some popular contests.

FST4 and FST4W are designed particularly for the LF and MF bands. On these bands
their fundamental sensitivities are better than other WSJT-X modes with the same
sequence lengths, approaching the theoretical limits for their rates of
information throughput. FST4 is optimized for two-way QSOs, while FST4W is for
quasi-beacon transmissions of WSPR-style messages. FST4 and FST4W do not require
the strict, independent time synchronization and phase locking of modes like
EbNaut.

As described more fully on its own page, WSPR mode implements a protocol
designed for probing potential propagation paths with low-power transmissions.
WSPR is fully implemented within WSJT-X, including programmable "band-hopping".
